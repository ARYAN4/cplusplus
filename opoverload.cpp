// It gives new definition to operator, use with user defined data type.
// Ex obj1+opbj2 opeartor +(obj1,obj2), obj is object,struct,enum
// Operator function two type 1- member operator function, 2- Non member function operator.
// Non member operator function is also two type 1- Global function operator , 2- Friend function operator
// While overloading = opeartor be precise as deep and shallow copy will come in to picture
// overloading of IO stream is not possible with global and member opoerator function, so use friend operator function.
